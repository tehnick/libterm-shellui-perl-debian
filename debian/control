Description: Perl module for fully-featured shell-like command line environment
 Term::ShellUI uses the history and autocompletion features of Term::ReadLine
 to present a sophisticated command-line interface to the user. It tries to
 make every feature that one would expect to see in a fully interactive shell
 trivial to implement. You simply declare your command set and let ShellUI
 take care of the heavy lifting.
